Here's a suggested description for your GitHub `README.md` file based on the uploaded Python files, which collectively simulate a basic ATM banking system:

# 💳 Simple ATM Banking System (Console-Based)

This is a **Python-based console application** that simulates the basic operations of an ATM, including depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balance. The project is modular and demonstrates the use of file handling, user authentication, and input validation in Python.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── main.py              # Entry point of the application
├── account_logic.py     # Core banking logic (deposit, withdraw, balance check)
├── display_menu.py      # Menu display functions
├── validation.py        # Login and PIN validation
├── balance.json         # Stores current account balance
└── janhavi shende.zip   # (Optional archive – not used in code)
```

## 🚀 Features

* **User Authentication** via 4-digit PIN
* **Deposit Functionality** with input validation
* **Withdraw Functionality** with balance check
* **Balance Check** feature
* **Persistent Balance** using a JSON file
* Modular code with functions separated into different files

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Extract or clone the repository.
3. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🐞 Known Issues

* Several syntax and logical errors are present:

  * Typos in variable and function names (e.g., `josn`, `file_s`, `withDraw`, etc.)
  * Misuse of comparison and assignment operators.
  * Some variables are undefined or incorrectly named (`Saved_pin`, `menu_()`, etc.)
  * Missing import statements in `main.py`.

> 🛠 A refactor is recommended to correct naming conventions and logic flow.

## ✅ TODO

* Fix all syntax and naming errors.
* Improve exception handling.
* Enhance user interface with more feedback.
* Add PIN change and account creation features.

Would you like me to clean up and fix the code so that it runs correctly as well?
